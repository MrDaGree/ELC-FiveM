# ELC-FiveM

## What is ELC?

Emergency Lighting Control is a new way to have nice lighting without the hassle for modelers, like non-els configs, and fix issues that ELS has like doors flickering, repairing, etc. It even allows up to 30 different lights on 1 vehicle. Christmas trees can be brighter, non can have even better-looking patterns.

## Whats some of the benefits? Why switch?

Currently, the main reason Iâ€™m so excited for this is to fix the issues ELS has had in FiveM, things like repairing and issues surrounding it. If set up correctly with the model, you can even change the light colors on the fly.
